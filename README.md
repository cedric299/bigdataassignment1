##  Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the Uber Fares Dataset to gain insights into fare patterns, ride durations, and other key metrics using Power BI. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, statistical analysis, and interactive dashboard creation.

---

##  Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
GitHub (for version control and submission)

---

## Data Understanding & Preparation

 Dataset Source: [Kaggle - Uber Fares Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
 Explored the dataset structure and performed data quality assessments.
 Cleaned missing values, corrected data types, and removed outliers.
 Exported a cleaned CSV file for use in Power BI.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, quartiles, and standard deviations.
 Created visualizations to examine:

   Fare amount vs distance traveled
   Fare amount vs time of day
    Outlier detection via boxplots

---

##  Feature Engineering

 Extracted new features:

  Hour, Day, Month, Day of Week
    Peak vs Off-peak periods
  Encoded categorical variables where necessary.
 Saved the enhanced dataset for Power BI.

##  Power BI Data Analysis

 Imported the processed data into Power BI Desktop.
 Created visuals and KPIs to analyze:

  Ride and fare distribution over time
   Time-based trends (hourly, daily, monthly)
  Identified peak ride periods
   Geographic fare patterns (if location data available)
